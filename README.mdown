## Running tests

To run, you need to have [phpunit](http://www.phpunit.de) installed to run the tests.

To run all tests: 

`phpunit test/*`

There's also a [watchr](http://github.com/mynyml/watchr) spec file, should you choose expand this tiny library while doing TDD.

To start up watcher monitoring: 

`watchr specs.watchr`
